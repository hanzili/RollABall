# Roll A Ball Project
This is a project I done with guidence of Unity Official Tutorial. https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball
Apart from the featrues in tutorial, I 
- add buffer on the ground to make the ball have dynamic speed
- the counts rotating at different rate
- a cube always looking at the player no matter the position of the ball
